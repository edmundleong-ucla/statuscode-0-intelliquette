# The problem it solves
Feeling tired, frustrated, and worse than you felt before? Most patients experience this when consulting pharmacies, either in-person or online, for the best treatments, which may require more than one pharmaceutical product. That's because providers today see patients as a mixture of billing codes rather than people who have simple, yet complex, questions about their health. Intelliquette addresses them with its question-based (rather than product-based) UI, which connects the right combination of symptoms with conditions that best reflect a patient's health. These questions, as well as their corresponding responses, are produced by our bespoke AI-powered LangChain Large Language Model (LLM) syndicate, forming a distinct combination of technical acumen from models including Google's Flan-T5, Facebook's Blenderbot, and GPT-2.
