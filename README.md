While other digital pharmacies advertise their products without guidance for their patients, Intelliquette's back-end patient-to-pharmacy (P2P) service connects patients to the right products by asking them questions about their symptoms, then linking those symptoms to the most appropriate healthcare concerns.
# Intelliquette Starts by Asking the Right Questions
Feeling tired, frustrated, and worse than you felt before? Most patients experience this when consulting pharmacies, either in-person or online, for the best treatments, which may require more than one pharmaceutical product. That's because providers today see patients as a mixture of billing codes rather than people who have simple, yet complex, questions about their health. Intelliquette addresses them with its 'question-first' service methodology, which connects the right combination of symptoms with conditions that best reflect a patient's health. These questions are produced by our bespoke AI-powered Large Language Model (LLM).
